# BeaatsLoops

**A revolutionary platform for sharing and discovering 12-second audio loops with real-time audio visualization and spatial effects.**

BeaatsLoops transforms how musicians, producers, and beat makers share their creative work by combining automatic loop detection with immersive 3D visualizations and spatial audio processing.

## What is BeaatsLoops?

BeaatsLoops is a web-based audio platform that specializes in **12-second loops** - the perfect length for showcasing musical ideas, beats, and creative snippets. The platform features:

- **Automatic Loop Detection**: Advanced audio analysis ensures perfect seamless loops
- **3D Audio Visualization**: Real-time frequency analysis drives stunning wireframe visualizations  
- **Spatial Audio Effects**: Scroll-based doppler effects and 3D positioning
- **Creative Community**: A focused platform for loop-based musical expression

## Why 12 Seconds?

12 seconds is the optimal duration for:
- **Musical Ideas**: Long enough to establish a groove, short enough to stay focused
- **Social Sharing**: Perfect for attention spans and quick consumption
- **Creative Constraints**: Limitations often spark the most innovative solutions
- **Loop Perfection**: Ideal for seamless, hypnotic repetition

## Audio Technology & Libraries

BeaatsLoops is built on cutting-edge web audio technology:

- **Web Audio API**: Low-latency, real-time audio processing in the browser
- **Tone.js Framework**: Professional-grade audio synthesis and effects
- **AudioBuffer Processing**: Efficient loop analysis and manipulation
- **Real-time FFT Analysis**: Frequency domain processing for visualizations
- **Spatial Audio Engine**: 3D positioning and doppler effects

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Dependency: Prettier

**The Prettier library is absolutely essential for this project to build successfully.** Do not remove or skip installing Prettier, as it is required for:

- Code formatting during the build process
- Astro component processing
- SCSS/CSS file compilation
- Ensuring consistent code style across the project

If you encounter build errors, verify that Prettier is properly installed:

```bash
npm list prettier
```

If missing, reinstall dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Deployment

This project is configured for deployment on Railway. The deployment process is automatically triggered when you push to the main branch of your repository.
